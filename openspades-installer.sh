I cannot guarantee that the program will run, but there is only one way to figure that out...  The game must be run from the desktop; it will not run from the command line.  Overclocking is basically required in order to make the game playable.  Settings can be changed both ingame and through the SPConfig.cfg file.  The three settings which will significantly change the game's performance are r_videoHeight, r_videoWidth, and r_swUndersampling.  Don't freak out about the framerate at the main menu, it gets somewhat better ingame...

This is in no way practical.  It is just a testament to both the scalability of the game, and the versatility of the Raspberry Pi.  I only attempted this for the memes, as I am sure you did too.  Hope you enjoy gaming at 20FPS!
